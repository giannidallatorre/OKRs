# python-OKRs-statistics
This repository contains python clients to generate statistics about the total CPU/h and the number of users of the EGI Federated Infrastructure. 
Specifically, the statistics generated by these clients are:
- **Cloud CPU/h** consumed by the production VOs of EGI
- **HTC CPU/h** consumed by the production VOs of EGI
- Num. of **'active'**, **'total'** and **'actual' users** registered in the EGI Operations Portal. 

These statistics will be used by EGI to measure progress following the **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** goal-setting framework.

The statistics generated by these clients will be pushed in this Google <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B1Sqf1UiN9pY_fGbWe5G1zKA2UzsekOVbLCtiiMFAXk/edit#">Worksheet</a> using the <a href="https://docs.gspread.org/en/v5.10.0/">gspread</a> API.

## Pre-requisites
* Python 3.10.12+ and pip3 installed on your local computer.
* To install pip3: `apt-get install python3-pip`
* Istall gspread: `sudo pip3 install gspread`

## Creating a Google Service Account
In order to read from and write data to Google Sheets in Python, we will have to create a **Google Service Account**.

_"A service account is a special kind of account used by an application or a virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person. 
Applications use service accounts to make authorized API calls, authorized as either the service account itself or as Google Workspace 
or Cloud Identity users through domain-wide delegation"._

**Instructions** to create a service account are the following:
* Head over to <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">Google developer console</a> and click on “**Create Project**”.
* Fill in the required fields and click on “**Create**”. You will be redirected to the project home page once the project is created.
* Click on “**Enable API and Services**”.
* Search for Google Drive API and click on “**Enable**”. Do the same for the Google Sheets API.
* Click on “**Create Credentials**”
* Select “**Google Drive API**” as the API and “Web server” (e.g. Node.js, Tomcat, etc.) as where you will be calling the API from. Follow the image below to fill in the other options.
* Name the service account, then grant it a “**Project**” role with “**Editor**” access and click on “**Continue**”.
* The credentials will be created and downloaded as a JSON file. If everything is successful, you will see a screen similar to the image below.
* Copy the JSON file to your code directory and rename it to `credentials.json`
